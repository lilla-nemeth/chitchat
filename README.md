# ChitChat

## Description

ChitChat is a chat application with socket.io. Initially, it was just a test project to create a chat app quickly. Now I think it deserves a lot more. The updated version is coming soon (with database, authentication and so on...)

ðŸ›  Technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Redux, Socket.io and Node.js. UI is made by custom design. For styling I used Styled Components.
