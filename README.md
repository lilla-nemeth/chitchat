# ChitChat

## Note (*Upcoming changes*)

The app is under construction, even works as intended. Initially, it was just a test project to create a chat app quickly. Now I think that it deserves more e.g database with ORM, authentication and so on...

## Description

ChitChat is a chat application with rooms.

ðŸ›  Created with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Redux, Socket.io and Node.js. UI is made by custom design. For styling I used Styled Components.

### Frontend

Go to the client folder

```

Install the dependencies

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn run dev

## Add environment variables (*Upcoming changes*)

## Frontend

The app uses Auth.js with Auth0 provider for authentication.

First, create a .env.local file (for local development) inside of the frontend folder.

Generate AUTH0_SECRET environment variable with

```
npx auth secret
```

and copy to the dotenv file.

To use Auth0, create your own account with a Next.js application on their website, configure the Application URIs, then add these variables with your credentials:

```
AUTH0_BASE_URL
```

```
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL
```

```
AUTH_AUTH0_ID
```

```
AUTH_AUTH0_SECRET
```
